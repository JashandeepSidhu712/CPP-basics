# MEMORY MANAGEMENT

## STACK AND HEAP

#### Function Call Management in Stack:

1. When a function is called, a new stack frame (also known as activation record) is created to hold its local variables and return address.
2. The function's parameters, local variables, and return address are stored in this stack frame.
