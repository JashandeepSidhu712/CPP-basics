# STANDARD TEMPLATE LIBRARY

The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) is a powerful set of **pre-built classes and functions provided by the C++ programming language**. It is a part of the C++ Standard Library and offers a collection of container classes, algorithms, and iterators that help to manage and manipulate data efficiently.

The **primary components of the C++ STL** include:
1. Containers
2. Iterators
3. Algorthms
4. Functions

## CONTAINERS

In C++ STL (Standard Template Library), containers are **classes that are used to store and manage collections of data elements**. <br>
Containers provide various methods and functionalities to access, insert, remove, and manipulate elements. They are a fundamental part of the C++ STL and are widely used in C++ programming to manage data efficiently.
