# LINKED LIST
A linked list is a **linear data structure** that consists of a **sequence of elements called nodes**, where each node contains both data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. 

The first node is called the head, and the last node typically points to NULL.

## TYPES OF LINKED LIST

### SINGLY LINKED LIST:
A singly linked list is a type of linked list where each node points only to the next node in the list.

```
+------+    +------+
| Data | -> | Next | -> NULL
+------+    +------+
```

### DOUBLY LINKED LIST:
A doubly linked list is a type of linked list where each node points to both the next and the previous nodes in the list.

```
+------+    +-------+    +-------+
| Prev | <->| Data  | <->| Next  |
+------+    +-------+    +-------+
```

### CIRCULAR LINKED LIST:
A circular linked list is a type of linked list where the last node points back to the first node, forming a loop.

```
+------+    +------+
| Data | -> | Next | -> ...
+------+    +------+
   ^                  |
   |                  v
   +------------------+
```

## IMPORTANT TERMINOLOGY

### HEAD POINTER:
The pointer that points to the first node in the linked list is called the head pointer.

### NODE:
A basic unit of a linked list that contains data and a reference to the next (and possibly previous) node.

### NULL POINTER:
A special pointer value (usually denoted as NULL or nullptr) that indicates the end of the linked list.
