# RECURSION

Recursion is a programming technique where a **function calls itself in order to solve a problem until specific condition is met**. 

It's like a concept of "**self-reference**" in programming. Recursion is often used to **break down complex problems into simpler subproblems** that can be solved more easily.

Imagine you have a problem that can be solved by dividing it into smaller instances of the same problem. You solve each smaller instance in the same way, and when you combine the solutions to these smaller instances, you get the solution to the original problem. This is the basic idea behind recursion.

In the context of programming, a recursive function is a **function that calls itself with a modified version of the input until it reaches a base case**, where the function doesn't call itself anymore. The base case is essential to prevent infinite recursion and to ensure the function eventually stops.
