# NUMBER THEORY

Number theory is a branch of pure mathematics that explores the **properties and relationships of integers, focusing on their fundamental characteristics and patterns**. 

It deals with the study of whole numbers and their properties, including prime numbers, divisibility, greatest common divisors, modular arithmetic, and congruences. 

Number theory is a foundational field that has practical applications in various areas, such as **cryptography, computer science, and algorithm design**. Key concepts in number theory include prime factorization, modular arithmetic, primality testing, and algorithms for solving number-related problems efficiently. 

Understanding number theory is essential for developing robust and optimized algorithms in computational mathematics and computer programming.
