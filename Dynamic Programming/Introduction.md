# DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING
Dynamic programming is a powerful algorithmic technique used to **solve complex optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller**, **overlapping subproblems** and **efficiently reusing their solutions**. 

### FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING
1. overlapping subproblems
2. optimal substructure

The technique involves **solving smaller subproblems** and **storing their solutions** in a data structure, like an array or a hash table.  It **avoids redundant calculations** and **saves time**. We use it when a problem can be divided into overlapping subproblems and the **solution to the main problem depends on the solutions of those subproblems**.

### APPROACHES FOR DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING
1. Memoization (top-down) 
2. Tabulation bottom-up

By applying dynamic programming, we can transform inefficient exponential time algorithms into efficient polynomial time algorithms, making it crucial for solving a wide range of computational problems efficiently. 

Its applications span across various domains, including combinatorial optimization, graph algorithms, sequence alignment, and more. Understanding dynamic programming and being able to identify problems that can be solved using this technique demonstrate an essential skill set for solving complex real-world problems efficiently and optimally.
